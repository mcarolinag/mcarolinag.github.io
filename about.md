Hi!

I am Data Scientists with experience managing teams. I started my journey into data science while working for GE. I worked for a product in GE Water that didn't have an 'analyst'. As part of my job I needed Data! I have learned a lot of thing by myself, also I took classes in the evening at the University of Washington and joined the [Metis Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.thisismetis.com/data-science-bootcamps) a few years ago. 

I worked at Outreach for almost 3.5 years as a Data Scientist and later as a Operations Data Science Manager. As a Data Science manager, I  translated business problems into data science projects and worked with internal teams in defining project goals, deliverables and timelines based on existing pain points.  I hired, onboarded and mentored team members and developed a career ladder for the Operations Data Science team.  I also executed some of the projects such as predicting customer Expansions and Custumer Life Time Value. I also Supported team members by reviewing code and troubleshooting specific project issues.

### Outside Data Science

I love outdoor activities running, biking, camping or just walking. My husband and I are raising our son and have the best dog ever -Carmen.

I enjoy yoga and I practice vipassana meditation.
